<p class="purple">A way home is a 3D game which explores mental illness's such as depression, loneliness and anxiety.
    You as the player will play as the the 'Fisherman' who is on a boat and in space and essentially you will go through a journey and
    there will be many obstacles such as asteriods and black holes which will represent the main issues.
